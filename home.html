          <p>The year is 2100, and light and joy are things of the past. The streaming services and social media platforms which first gained popularity in the  early 2000s and 2010s have all been acquired by each other into a massive media corporation called MEDIA, run by a set of corporate A.I:s.</p>
          <p>The human world has fallen under the trance of the powerful algorithms of MEDIA. In their ever-increasing data mining efforts, MEDIA managed to finally sucked the life out of everything, stealing light and color from the world.</p>
          <p>Before their descent into MEDIA, humanity built in a set of fail-safes to save them from the threat of A.I, scattered throughout the world. A solitary tribe of fairies awaken after a night's sleep to find the planet overrun with darkness. Can they find their way through it?</p>
