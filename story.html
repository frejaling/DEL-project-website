        <p> future is here. The year is 2100, and quality media is a thing of the past. The streaming services and social media platforms which first gained popularity in the  early 2000s and 2010s have all been acquired by each other into a massive social media corporation called MEDIA, which now produces so called ‘content sludge’ – a type of media designed only to capture the viewer’s attention but does contain or communicate anything of value.</p> 

        <p>“‘You're watching it and you're not really taking it in — it's just something to stimulate you,’ he said. ‘It's like Cocomelon,’ a YouTube channel geared toward infants — but here, aimed at adults.
        But what Oberman saw is just a small example of what the few people who have studied it are calling 'sludge content.'
        And while it seems insidious, Oberman says it's an experience shared by many on the app: TikTok's video recommendation algorithm, which is supposed to deliver content based on your interests, relentlessly showing users clips packaged in a very particular, and overstimulating, way."</p>
        
        <p>Back during the days of the AI goldrush, MEDIA automated many of their business processes. This automation gradually progressed until there were no humans left working for MEDIA, only a set of artificial intelligences striving towards the main goal of MEDIA – capture as many viewers as possible, and mine as much data as possible.</p> 
        
        <p>The human world soon fell under the trance of the powerful algorithms of MEDIA, spending all their free time watching content sludge, too hyperstimulated to do anything else. In their ever-increasing data mining efforts, MEDIA managed to finally sucked the life out of everything, stealing light and color from the world.</p>
        
        <p>Before their descent into the media, humanity installed a set of fail-safes in the unfortunate case of A.I:s taking over the world. They are scattered about, designed as real-life captchas – puzzles which A.I cannot solve.</p>
        
        <p>Unbeknownst to humanity and MEDIA, fairies have been living deep in the last parts of nature not yet covered by cities. They have so far not been interested in the affairs of man, and care little about the descent of humanity. That is, until light and color were stolen. The fairies now emerge to solve the puzzle of how to bring life back to earth.</p>
