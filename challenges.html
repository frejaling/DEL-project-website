        <p>There are many different challenges to choose from with great variation. Here as an example is the forest run, and one marathon in one week.
            The icons in the bottom right corner indicates whether a challenge has been completed, challenged by someone, or liked. <br class="brk"></br>
            All challenges can be completed in casual mode, and some are available as ranked challenges. When you complete a ranked challenge you earn points relative to how you performed vs. everyone else who also completed that challenge. This rating is what determines the leaderboard scores. </p>
